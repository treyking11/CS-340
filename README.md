1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

This module is easily re-usable (the whole purpose of a module) and could be used to interact with other databases.


2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

i had to look carefully at what was being asked, and be sure to return that data. building a module that can handle different typrs of queries is key.


3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

a good computer scientist should be able to anticipate the type of data that will be requested, and have mechanisms in place to return it.
